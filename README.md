# (SLOPPY!) LightShot-Dumper
LightShot is a free to use service for uploading images and generating a link for them. Links generated by LighShot contain an ID referencing ever single image. These IDs consist of 6 characters from which each is a small letter (a-z) or a number (0-9). Because of this "pattern" it is possible to iterate all IDs and download all of the referenced images.


## Requirements
Following modules must be installed to use the script:
`request`
`Beautifulsoup 4`

A textfile named `failedIDs.txt` must be present in the scripts directory. It will store all IDs which do not reference an image.

## Usage
`python ls-dumper.py [DOWNLOADDIR]`
